# #1: My original, (overly?) simple solution
puts "Andrew " + "Buckingham" # Andrew Buckingham

# #2: From the books's solution; assigns variables and then concatenates them:

fname = "Andrew"
lname = "Buckingham"

puts fname + " " + lname

# #3: From the book's solution; using string interpolation:
puts "#{fname} #{lname}"
