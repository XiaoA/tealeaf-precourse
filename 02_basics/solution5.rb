# Write a program that outputs the factorial of the numbers 5, 6, 7, and 8.
# My solution
five = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
six = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
seven = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
eight = 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1

puts five
puts six
puts seven
puts eight

# Book solution
puts 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 
puts 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
puts 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
puts 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1

# This is the same as what I first came up with, but then I decided to assign variables...
