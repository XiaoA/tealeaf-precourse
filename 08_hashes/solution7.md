### My answers
1. my_hash uses the symbol ':x' (Ruby 1.9 or later)
2. my_hash2 uses the older, pre-1.9 'hash-rocket'.

### The authors' answer
The first hash that was created used a symbol x as the key. The second hash used the string value of the x variable as the key.

### My comments
In addition to 'hash rocket,' I should remember that **=>** is a 'string value of the x variable.'
