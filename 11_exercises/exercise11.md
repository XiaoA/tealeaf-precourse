### Look at several Rails/Ruby online API sources and say which one you like best and why.

I'm a beginner, so I'm sure my answer will change later, but as I looked through the Ruby APIs, with so many new and interesting tools, I smiled when I saw 'YAML.'

I spent a lot of time this year, working with Jekyll blogging, and I build my own site with Jekyll. YAML allows Jekyll to configure their sites, or even individual pages; the title, permalinks, tags, categtories, and third-party account information (e.g., Google+, Flickr, Twitter, etc.). It's an amazingly simple and yet powerful resource for Jekyll.

**YAML** stands for 'YAML ain't Markup Language.' And that's true. It's so much more! 

Looking at the [YAML documentation](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.1.3/libdoc/yaml/rdoc/YAML.html), I was surprised to learn that the original implementation in the Ruby Standard Library was developed by [Why the Lucky Stiff](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/). I read his Poignant Guide this summer, and it was a great motivator to delve deeper into Ruby.

As I reach the end of the first Pre-Course materials, and prepare to embark on the first course, I am excited about what I'll learn, but I am also happy to enjoy the new feelings of optimism and open possibilities that are strongest at the beginning of a new journey of learning and discovery...
