## What's the major difference between an Array and a Hash?

### Arrays
- ordered lists
- can contain any data types
- can be nested
- usually referenced by index

### Hashes
- key/value pairs
- can contain any value types, as long as they share a key/value relationship
- similar to a simple database
- can be referenced by key or value

Arrays are lists that hold data. Hashes are key/value pairs, which store relational data.
