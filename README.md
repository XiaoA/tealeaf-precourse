# What is this?

This repository is a record of the pre-course exercises from the "Learn Ruby" text at [Tealeaf Academy](http://gotealeaf.com).

I will be completing the exercises on the Command Line, in IRB, and in [emacs org-mode](http://www.orgmode.org). The top level contains my notes. These notes include notes, explanation, and source code. Through the magic of Org-Mode's [Babel function](http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/), I can write the Ruby code once in my notes, and then "tangle" the code, which *automagically* creates separate Ruby files! 

Each subdirectory corresponds to a chapter in the book:
