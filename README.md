# What is this?

This repository is a record of the pre-course exercises from the "Learn Ruby" text at [Tealeaf Academy](http://gotealeaf.com/books/ruby).

I will be completing the exercises on the Command Line, in IRB, and in [emacs org-mode](http://www.orgmode.org). The top level [notes.org](https://github.com/XiaoA/tealeaf-precourse/blob/master/notes.org) file contains my notes. These notes include notes, explanation, and source code. Through the magic of Org-Mode's [Babel function](http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/), I can write the Ruby code once in my notes, and then "tangle" (export) the code, which *automagically* creates separate Ruby files! 

If you want to follow my work, check there. However, it's over 7000 lines, so it's a pretty big document! My exercises (plus some original 'extra credit' exercises I did for more practice) have been exported to Ruby or Markdown files, and can be found in the appropriate subdirectory.

Each subdirectory corresponds to a chapter in the book:


1. Preparations
2. The Basics
3. Variables
4. Methods
5. Flow Control
6. Loops & Iterators
7. Arrays
8. Hashes
9. Files
10. More Stuff
