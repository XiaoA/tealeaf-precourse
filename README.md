# What is this?

This repository is a record of the pre-course exercises from the "Learn Ruby" text at [Tealeaf Academy](http://gotealeaf.com/books/ruby).

All of the exercises were completed on the BASH Command Line, in IRB, and in [emacs org-mode](http://www.orgmode.org). The top level [notes.org](https://github.com/XiaoA/tealeaf-precourse/blob/master/notes.org) file contains my full documentation. This includes detailed notes, explanations, and all of the source code. Through the magic of Org-Mode's [Babel function](http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/), I can write the Ruby code once in my notes, and then "tangle" (export) the code into the appropriate subdirectory, which *automagically* creates separate Ruby files! 

If you want to follow my work, check **notes.org**; *everything* is there. However, it's over 7000 lines, so it's a pretty big document! My exercises (plus some original 'extra credit' exercises I did for more practice) have been exported to Ruby or Markdown files, and can be found in the appropriate subdirectory.

Each subdirectory corresponds to a chapter in the book:


1. [Preparations](https://github.com/XiaoA/tealeaf-precourse/tree/master/01_preparation)
